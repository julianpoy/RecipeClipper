Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire
Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.
Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold
Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold
Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil
Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.
After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate
Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!",

  "instructions": "Pie crust: I like to make sure my pie dough is prepared before I begin the quiche. Make pie dough the night before because it needs to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before rolling out and blind baking (next step).
Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Partially blind bake your pie crust. Follow blind baking instructions through step 9 in your 9-inch pie dish. Step 4 is optional, though that step guarantees thick pie crust edges. Crust can still be warm when you pour in the filling. (You can partially pre-bake the crust up to 3 days ahead of time. Cover cooled crust tightly and refrigerate until ready to fill.)
Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (177°C).
In a large bowl with a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs, whole milk, heavy cream, salt, and pepper together on high speed until completely combined, about 1 minute. Whisk in add-ins.
Bake the quiche until the center is just about set, about 45-55 minutes. Don’t over-bake. Use a pie crust shield to prevent the pie crust edges from over-browning. Allow to cool for 15 minutes. Top with optional toppings before slicing and serving, if desired. Or you can cool the quiche completely before serving– it’s fantastic at room temperature!
This quiche makes great leftovers! Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.",

3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided
¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided
¼ teaspoon kosher salt, divided
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 large egg
1 tablespoon heavy cream",
  "instructions": "[Recipe Preparation]
Dough
Pour milk into a measuring glass or small bowl; sprinkle yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar over milk. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.
Whisk egg, egg yolk, and remaining ¼ cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisk in yeast mixture.
Combine salt and 2 cups flour in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add egg mixture and beat on low speed until nearly incorporated, about 30 seconds. Switch to dough hook and add 7 Tbsp. butter; beat on medium-low until butter is completely incorporated and dough is smooth and just slightly sticky, 8–10 minutes.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times until very smooth (dough will still be wet and a little sticky). Transfer to a large buttered bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1½–2 hours, then chill 45 minutes.
Filling and Assembly
Preheat oven to 350°. Generously butter a 8½x4½\\" loaf pan. Heat chocolate, cocoa, 2 Tbsp. butter, 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar, ¼ tsp. cinnamon, and ⅛ tsp. salt in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, until chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth. (Alternatively, microwave on medium power 1 minute, stirring halfway through.)
Turn out chilled dough onto a clean lightly floured surface. Roll out to a 22x12\\" rectangle and orient so a long side is facing you. Using an offset spatula, spread chocolate filling over dough to extend to the edges. Roll up dough away from you like a jelly roll, pulling lightly on it as you roll to maintain thickness. (Use a metal bench scraper if needed to help dough release from surface.)
Cut log in half crosswise. Set halves so they are side by side and touching. A long side should still be facing you. Place one half over the other to make an X, then twist the two ends on one side twice. Repeat on opposite side. (You should have a total of 4 twists.) Transfer bread to pan, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the streusel. Whisk brown sugar and remaining 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar, ½ tsp. cinnamon, and ⅛ tsp. salt in medium bowl to blend. Mix in remaining 2 Tbsp. butter. Add flour and toss with a fork until moist clumps form (streusel will look slightly wet). Whisk egg and cream in a small bowl and brush egg wash over loaf. Scatter streusel over top.
Bake babka, rotating pan halfway through, until golden brown, 50–60 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let babka cool in pan 15 minutes, then turn out onto rack, running a paring knife around edges to help loosen if needed. Let cool completely before slicing.",

How to tell when cake is done
[By Kye Ameden]
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well at medium-high speed between additions.
Scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing bowl, and mix for 30 seconds more. The batter will be thin.
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan(s) of your choice. Smooth out the tops of the layers with an offset spatula.
Bake for 34 minutes for a 9\\" x 13\\" pan, 28 to 30 minutes for 9\\" layers, and 24 to 26 minutes for 8\\" layers.
The cake is done when the top springs back when very lightly touched in the center, and the edges just begin to pull away from the edge of the pan. A cake tester inserted in the center will come out clean.
Remove the cake from the oven and let cool completely in the pan(s) on a rack before turning out of the pans to frost.
Cake layers can be wrapped and frozen for up to a month before frosting.
Tips from our Bakers
The volume of this batter is 5 3/4 cups. It will rise quite a bit during baking. The weight of the batter is 3 pounds, 1 ounce. If you're weighing out layers, put 1 pound, 8 1/2 ounces in each 9\\" layer, or 1 pound in each 8\\" layer.
We've tested this cake with natural unsweetened cocoa, and with Dutch-process; both work well. The Dutch-process cake will be darker in color and slightly less sweet.
Try frosting this cake with Seven-Minute Frosting as shown here.
The butter in this recipe needs to be very soft. If you can leave a dent in the butter with a gentle touch, it's ready to use.
